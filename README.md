# 03_Dynamic_Array
In this program, I used dynamic array to store numbers as elements and added them.

## What can I improve or change :
- Try and Declare variables in a single statement, this could maybe improve the readability of my program upto some extent.
- In line 17 there was no need of the Int type variable "sizeofarr".
- I could also have used "calloc" function instead of "malloc" but it really doesn't matter for this specific program.
- Could maybe add little bit comments.
